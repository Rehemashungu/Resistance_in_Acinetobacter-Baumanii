# Resistance_in_Acinetobacter-Baumanii

## The purpose of this repository is to replicate the study,'Schultz MB, Pham Thanh D, Tran Do Hoan N, et al. Repeated local emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a single hospital ward. Microb Genom. 2016;2(3):e000050. Published 2016 Mar 2. doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000050" for non-publication reasons using bioinformatics tools taught during my genomics course with HackBio.

## The aim of the paper was to understand, identify and study the population of imipenem-resistant A.baumanii and investigate their phylogenetic relationship to the imipenem-susceptible type, all isolated from the same hospital ward but at different periods of time.
